This dataset accompanies the manuscript titled Differential impacts of invasion on plant communities of two types of savannas in India; submitted to Ecological Applications. It includes raw data from all analyses presented in the manuscript and is provided to support the findings and ensure transparency for replication studies.

Herbaceous_species: This file contains the raw data used to quantify alpha diversity, compositional changes and beta diversity measures across invasion gradient in the two types of savannas. The dataset includes columns for Savvana_type (Fine leaf savanna vs Broad Leaf Savanna), Site (three sites studied within each savanna), Location (five locations each site six in saswad), Invasion_gradient (Remnant, Uninvaded, Low, Medium and High), Quadrat (ten quadrats per location), Species, percent_cover, Nativity and lifeform of the species.

Woody_species: This file contains the raw data used to qunatify abundance of woody species across the invasion gradient.The dataset includes columns for Savvana_type (Fine leaf savanna vs Broad Leaf Savanna), Site (three sites studied within each savanna), Location (five locations each site six in saswad), Invasion_gradient (Remnant, Uninvaded, Low, Medium and High), Species, Lifeform (Shrubs and Trees) and measure of GBH (in case of tree) and length transect (in case of shrub).
